        About the Featured Collections
    </h2>
    <p class="flow-text light">
        The Louis Round Wilson Library houses the special collections at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It houses five key collections: the North Carolina Collection, the Rare Book Collection, the Southern Folklife Collection, the Southern Historical
        Collection, and the University Archives and Records Management Services. The documents within these collections are available for research and for use in the classroom as teaching and learning tools. Additionally, many of these collections have
        been fully digitized or are undergoing the digitization process. A list of fully digitized collections can be found here alongside some notable digital exhibits hosted by Wilson.

    <p class="flow-text light">
        We have included this Special Collections page because many of the spotlighted digital projects use documents from these collections for their research or pedagogical projects. Whether as teaching tools or as data, the immense trove of documents and potential
        resources on the American South and the peoples who live(d) within should be highlighted alongside the projects and scholars. Below are featured collections that are either completely or partially digitized. We have also included collections that
        havenâ€™t been used but may serve as inspiration for future digital research on the South!

                <p class="truncate"> Cameron family of Orange and Durham counties and Raleigh, N.C. Among antebellum North Carolina's largest landholders and slave holders, the Camerons also owned substantial plantations in Alabama and Mississippi.

                <span class="card-title"> Eastern Kentucky African American Migration Project Collection</span>
                <p class="truncate"> The Eastern Kentucky African American Migration Project (EKAAMP) is a public humanities and archival collecting initiative directed by Karida Brown, an African American sociologist, in partnership with the Southern Historical Collection (SHC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, an historically white institution. In 2013, the SHC joined Brown in her efforts to document a multi-generational African American community with familial ties to coal mining towns in Harlan County, Ky. The community which Brown studies has its origins in the coalfields of the Appalachian South and specifically the surrounding area of Lynch, Ky. Appalachia was a destination for thousands of African Americans, who left the rural deep South in the early twentieth century during the Great Migration. A company town, Lynch was established in 1917 by U.S. Coal and Coke Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. The collection contains oral history interviews, photographs, copies of documents and artifacts related to coal miners in the mid-twentieth century, and community histories of Lynch, Ky. Karida Brown conducted the oral history interviews with African Americans whose families migrated from the coal camps of the Appalachian South to cities and suburbs across the country. Photographs from circa 1948 depict street scenes, residential areas, and coal mining facilities in Lynch, Ky., and also African American residents of Lynch, both adults and children. Copied documents include floor plans for company housing and a discharge report for a fired coal miner. Artifacts include a hard hat, goggles, and other work tools and safety accessories. Community histories describe the founding of the coal camp, the buildings and businesses in the company town of Lynch, schools, entertainment venues, and leisure activities.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> W. T. Couch (1901), a white publisher and editor, was also a part-time official of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration, as assistant and associate director for North Carolina, 1936-1937, and as director for the southern region, 1938-1939. These papers include his correspondence relating to the project and narratives (called 'life histories') of about 1,200 individuals, written by about 60 members of the project after one or more oral history interviews with the subjects. Persons interviewed, many of them African Americans, described life in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. There is a partial index to the many occupations of those interviewed. Also included, on microfilm, are ghost stories, local legends, etc., gathered in the project.</p>

                <span class="card-title"> Karen L. Parker Diary, Letter, and Clippings</span>
                <p class="truncate"> The first African-American woman undergraduate to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Karen L. Parker was born in Salisbury, N.C., and grew up in Winston-Salem, N.C. Parker majored in journalism and after graduating in 1965, Parker began a career in newspapers that took her to the Grand Rapids Press, the Los Angeles Times, and to other newspapers before returning to the Winston-Salem Journal. The collection is Karen L. Parker's diary with entries 5 November 1963-11 August 1966. The entries appear regularly every few weeks in the beginning of the diary and gradually appear less often, ending with entries every several months. Parker began the diary while she was a student majoring in journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One of the first entries concerns the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, her observations of reactions in Chapel Hill to the assassination, and her own thoughts and feelings about it. Diary entries describe her experiences as the first African American woman undergraduate to attend UNC-Chapel Hill, her involvement with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), her participation in civil rights demonstrations against segregation in Chapel Hill, and her arrest after entering a segregated Chapel Hill restaurant. An entry dated 30 April 1964 describes the visit of former segregationist governor of Mississippi Ross R. Barnett to the UNC-Chapel Hill campus and his remarks about the inferiority of African Americans. The diary also includes entries detailing Parker's observations and experiences concerning race relations and discrimination in Grand Rapids, Mich., while copy editor for the Grand Rapids Press and her changing views of the civil rights movement as she considered the merits of self-defense as opposed to non-violent resistance. Entries throughout the diary describe her thoughts about where she belonged as an educated African-American female during the civil rights era. Additions consist of a letter from Katherine Kennedy Carmichael, Dean of Women at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, to Karen L. Parker's mother, F.D. Parker, concerning Karen L. Parker's arrest on 19 December 1963, and newspaper clippings about Karen L. Parker's accomplishments as a journalism student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> The Media and the Movement Collection contains audio recordings, 1969-1978, and supporting documentation related to Black-owned community radio stations across the American South. Materials correspond to 'Media and the Movement: Journalism, Civil Rights, and Black Power in the American South,' an oral history project from 2011-2015 based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Southern Oral History Program and funded by the North Carolina Humanities Council and National Endowment for the Humanities. Seth Kotch, a white Associate Professor and historian in UNC's Department of American Studies, and Joshua Clark Davis (position: Assistant Professor of History, University of Baltimore; race: white) directed the project, which aims to understand the media and activism ecosystem of the American South during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s through oral history work and by digitizing rare and endangered sound recordings from Black-owned radio stations across the southern and eastern United States. The collection contains the radio broadcasts compiled by the Media and the Movement Project's team of researchers, which consist mostly of analog open reel and digitized radio broadcasts from WAFR (Durham, N.C.), in addition to digitized radio broadcasts from WVSP (Warrenton, N.C.), WRFG (Atlanta, Ga.), and WBAI (New York, N.Y.). Material was donated by Obataiye Akinwole, a Black radio host and staff member at WAFR, Jereann King Johnson of WVSP, and Valeria Lee, also of WVSP. With the exception of the analog open reel radio broadcasts from WAFR compiled and donated by Obataiye Akinwole, the Media and the Movement Project's team of researchers borrowed, digitized, and then returned original recordings to their owners. Analog and digitized radio broadcasts found in the collection contain interviews, recorded speeches and lectures, educational programs, local news, music, and other segments with a focus on African American music and programming. Of particular note are interviews and appearances by Bobby Seale, Floyd McKissick, Yusuf Salim, Joan Little, Dr. Benjamin Mays, Ben Ruffin, Maynard Jackson, Anne Braden, Alice Balance, Algia Mae Hinton, and Guitar Slim, among others. Other programs discuss the role of African Americans in the development of the United States, music and poetry, the Vietnam War, health, the history of Kwanzaa, and a variety of social issues, such as incarceration and suicide among Black women. The collection also contains supporting documentation, including digital tape logs of the digitized radio broadcasts prepared by the grant project team, as well as loose papers found with the analog open reel radio broadcasts from WAFR.</p>

                <span class="card-title"> University of North Carolina Papers</span>
                <p class="truncate"> The University of North Carolina was chartered by the state's General Assembly in 1789. Its first student was admitted in 1795. The governing body of the University, from its founding until 1932, was a forty-member Board of Trustees elected by the General Assembly. The Board met twice a year; at other times the business of the University was carried on by the Board's secretary-treasurer and by the presiding professor (called president beginning in 1804). Other faculty members later assumed the responsibilities of registrar and bursar. The administrative structure of the University remained essentially the same until the twentieth century. The collection consists of routine administrative correspondence and miscellaneous financial papers of the University of North Carolina as well as miscellaneous student and faculty records. Papers prior to 1874 are mainly those of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Board of Trustees; post-1874 papers are largely those of the President of the University. Twenty-three letterpress volumes contain the correspondence of Presidents Alderman and Venable, 1898-1904. The records also contain a number of early plats and other documents pertaining to University lands. Also included are numerous papers related to the University Normal School, a summer program for public school teacher training that began in 1877. The records also contain the correspondence, regulations and pay records of the World War I Student Army Training Corps. There is also a group of documents collected by President Swain for a proposed history of the University and a partial narrative written by Swain. The records in this group constitute most of the surviving eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and early twentieth-century records of the University. Individuals figuring prominently include Edwin Anderson Alderman; Kemp P. Battle; Joseph Caldwell; Robert H. Chapman; Harry Woodburn Chase; James Smiley Gillespie; Edward Kidder Graham; Charles Wilson Harris; Elisha Mitchell; Charles Phillips; Solomon Pool; Marvin Hendrix Stacy; David L. Swain; F. P. Venable; and George Tayloe Winston.</p>
