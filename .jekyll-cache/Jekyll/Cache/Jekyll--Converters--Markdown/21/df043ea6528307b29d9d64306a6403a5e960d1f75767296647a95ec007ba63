        About the Featured Projects
    </h2>
    <p class="flow-text light">
        Welcome to our Featured Projects page! This collection span humanities and social science departments through UNC while maintaining a focus in the American South while utilizing digital methods to carry their pedagogical or research goals. These methodologies
        range from GIS mapping to podcasting to text analysis, resulting in an intellectually rich array of projects.

    </p>


    <p class="flow-text light">
        Further, we have chosen to focus on projects that have been created in approximately the last 5 years with most being from the year or two. What this has let us discover is that Carolina is rich with digital pedagogy initiatives that allow students of
        all standing, faculty, and staff to collaborate with one another. These projects aren’t only focused on the classroom, as others originate from the scholars’ venture into special collections, digitized newspapers, and beyond. </p>

                <p class="truncate"> This project seeks to address the irony that despite the fact that members of lynch mobs documented their activities deliberately and prolifically, the physical spaces where lynchings took place remain, by and large,  unmarked. This project visualizes lynchings in new ways, to the extent possible privileging images of modern sites of historic lynchings over the mob-produced images of bodies that were intended to terrorize African Americans.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> Dr. Agbe-Davies has been researching the digitized Cameron Family Papers, stored in Wilson Library, which reveal much information about the operations of the Stagville Plantation in North Carolina. Notably, the collection includes information about Richard Bennehan's store. Using the 18th-19th century store records from the collection, Dr. Agbe-Davies aims to research the types of objects that furnished peoples' homes. As an archeologist, she is interested in the paths these objects took, people's choice of purchases, and how purchases changed through the seasons. Further, since documents of who purchased goods and how they purchased said goods are also available, Dr. Agbe-Davies also aims to use this  information to compare the purchasers, which included both enslaved and free peoples, their method of payment, and what they bought during this time period.      Further, in Dr. Agbe-Davies is also consulting the digitize George Washington Papers, also located in Wilson Special Collections, and the store records to continue her research on the lives of purchasers and purchased goods in the late 18th and 19th century.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> The Descendants Project, a collaboration between Dr. Hinson’s research, his students, local chapters of the NAACP, and the Equal Justice Initiative. This project aims to uncover the complete stories of victims of lynchings, their legacies, and their descendants in order to advocate for public memorialization of those victims. Tracing family histories through digital resources such as ancestry.com alongside digitized censuses, obituaries, birth records, and other available documents, the students in Dr. Hinson’s class become familiar with digital historical research that has a present-day impact. Their research then leads them into local communities to conduct interviews with the descendants of those who were victims of lynching, which are preserved in UNC’s Wilson Library as an oral history archive.Beyond the ultimate aim of this project to create public memorials for the victims of lynchings in their respective communities, this project also aims to develop curricula for schools to teach about their own local histories and create a website to make this project more publicly accessible.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> Dr. Martin's GEO429, 'Urban Political Geography of Durham, NC,' (an APPLES course) has students learn about structural and social problems by analyzing the complex city of Durham, NC. Students learn about Durham's history by utilizing historical North Carolina data and by consulting historical maps of Durham, located in Wilson Library's North Carolina Collection. Students research a particular section of history and communicate their findings through digital humanities projects. In the latest iteration (2021) of the course, students developed podcasts, allowing them to learn to use audio editing software and recording equipment alongside storytelling and interviewing techniques. In 2020, students created ArcGIS StoryMaps to communicate their research and experiential learning experiences.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> The Hidden in Plain Site is a collaboration between Dr. Leloudis, the University Commission on History, Race, and a Way Forward, and other scholars. The project begins with Dr. Leloudis and his students in his HIST 366 course, 'North Carolina History Before 1865,' looking through and transcribing ledgers and records within the University of North Carolina Papers (1757-1935) that mention enslaved peoples, whether the documents are medical records, receipts for labor, etc. Following the transcription process, the students do further research to find out more about the mentioned enslaved individuals through cross-referencing digitized state records, newspapers, or other sources. The aim of this research is to take the original mentions of enslaved individuals and retell these accounts in a way that humanizes them, instead of their mentions being mainly numbers. Students are able to reveal the active lives and histories of these individuals by learning about their professions, what work they did, and how the University depended on enslaved labor for its creation, income, and more.  Further, the project, beyond the students' research, aims to publicly present Carolinas's history, as it is embedded and engaged within the institution of slavery at the time. In the future, this project will aim to present this history in digital, interactive, and tactile modes.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> 'This StoryMap provides a multimedia tour of Karen Parker’s journal where she chronicled her experiences as the first Black woman undergraduate student in 1963-1965 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). Parker was a journalism major and a leader in the Civil Rights Movement during this critical time. UNC-CH has been known infamously as “The Light on the Hill” and the town of Chapel Hill has gained a reputation as a progressive, liberal town in a conservative Southern state. However, Parker’s journal tells a very different story. Hers is a story of struggle for freedom and inclusion in the face of violence and discrimination. Her journal reveals the racialized and gendered boundaries of exclusion and inequality at the university, in Chapel Hill, and nationwide during this time, as well as the fight for equality and justice. Parker gives a first hand account of how as a Black woman she felt out of place, isolated, excluded, and subjected to violence in many spaces of the university and Chapel Hill in her journal. She thrived against all odds.The journal also documents how students like Parker worked to create spaces of belonging and to transform an institution and a town that remained committed to white male dominance.'- Description taken from the Mapping Karen Parker's Journal website</p>

                <span class="card-title"> Layered Lives</span>
                <p class="truncate"> Rhetoric and Representation in the Southern Life History Project aims to create a completely digital-borne method of scholarship through a digital book. This project, which began by using theFederal Writers' Project Papers from Wilson Library's Special Collections to teach an ENGL 105 class so students could conduct research and create metadata about the life histories (similar to what we may now call 'Oral Histories') located in that collection. This evolved into the The Layered Lives project, where Dr. Rivard, alongside Dr. Arnold and Dr. Tilton (both at University of Richmond), look at how these life histories challenged and changed what it meant to be in the South. By compiling the documents into plain text, turning the documents' metadata to maps to see trends, they are able to visualize and uncover the 'rhetorical ecology' of the writing process of these life histories. This digital research analyzes and visualizes how the South was paint through the black/white binary and how indigenous, immigrant, and other writers of colors were excluded. Below is the abstract for the Layered Lives: Rhetoric and Representation in the Southern Life History Project, provided by Dr. Rivard: “The people, all the people, must be known, they must be heard,” proclaimed William T. Couch in 1939 from Chapel Hill. A respected editor turned part-time government bureaucrat, Couch served as both director of the University of North Carolina Press and the New Deal’s Federal Writers' Project (FWP) Southern Life History Project. As economic turmoil engulfed the nation, his concern for the voiceless led to the development of a new form of documentary expression called a “life history,” oral interviews of everyday people’s life experiences captured in writing by federal workers. Layered Lives: Rhetoric and Representation in the Southern Life History Project recovers the history of the SLHP and their efforts to reconfigure the life history method. We employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines close readings of archival material with computational methods that analyze pattern across the collection. The digital platform gives readers an opportunity to explore archival materials and data alongside our argument, which opens up new forms of reading and interaction in the humanities. We address five questions: What were the motivating factors behind the creation of the SLHP? How did the SLHP come into formation? How did the project come to define the form of a life history and who was capable of writing them? Who was represented in the life histories and why? What are the legacies of the SLHP? In addressing these questions, we demonstrate key points in the struggle over what counted as social knowledge, how to accurately represent social conditions, and who could produce such knowledge.</p>

Instead of proliferating racist ideas, can algorithms help us better study the history of race and advocate for justice?  An interdisciplinary team of UNC researchers, scholars, and experts–including several Research Hub librarians–developed a text mining project to answer these questions.On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance is a project of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries that used text mining and machine learning to discover Jim Crow and racially-based legislation signed into law in North Carolina between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement. The team developed:A publicly accessible, plain-text corpus of North Carolina Session Laws from 1866-1967 for general legal and historical research, and a list of Jim Crow laws discovered.A public git repository containing general scripts, open source software, and documentation for the benefit of similar projects.A short white paper describing their methods and workflows for accurate, large-scale OCR text conversion and text analysis for future teams seeking to create large-scale digital corpora and/or experiment with data-driven discovery.A website for educators and researchers interested in Southern and African American History that lists and contextualizes the North Carolina segregation laws identified.</p>

                <p class="truncate"> In collaboration with Dr. Eric Deetz, another archeologist at UNC, and Robin Frohardt, a visual artist, Dr. Agbe-Davies have been working on an effort to explore how used plastic materials can and should serve as artifacts. Historically, there has been little work to understand and study plastic objects as artifacts unlike more traditional archeological objects, like stone or pottery.[Source](https://onezero.medium.com/the-future-of-archeology-is-plastic-80fc689161de) One of the goals of this project is to think about how archeologists can classify plastic objects, and how proper categorization and identification of those artifacts may be recorded. By expanding the scope of what constitutes an object worthy of archeological study, this team hope think critically about the diversity of of these artifacts and how current tools may or may not be adequate to study them. Dr. Agbe-Davies hopes that a RDF (Resource Description Framework) can be developed to better tag and identify plastic objects.</p>
