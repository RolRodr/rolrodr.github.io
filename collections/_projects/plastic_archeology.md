description: In collaboration with Dr. Eric Deetz, another archeologist at UNC, and Robin Frohardt, a visual artist, Dr. Agbe-Davies have been working on an effort to explore how used plastic materials can and should serve as artifacts. Historically, there has been little work to understand and study plastic objects as artifacts unlike more traditional archeological objects, like stone or pottery.[Source](https://onezero.medium.com/the-future-of-archeology-is-plastic-80fc689161de) One of the goals of this project is to think about how archeologists can classify plastic objects, and how proper categorization and identification of those artifacts may be recorded. By expanding the scope of what constitutes an object worthy of archeological study, this team hope think critically about the diversity of of these artifacts and how current tools may or may not be adequate to study them. Dr. Agbe-Davies hopes that a RDF (Resource Description Framework) can be developed to better tag and identify plastic objects.
