description: "The Descendants Project, a collaboration between Dr. Hinson’s research, his students, local chapters of the NAACP, and the Equal Justice Initiative. This project aims to uncover the complete stories of victims of lynchings, their legacies, and their descendants in order to advocate for public memorialization of those victims. Tracing family histories through digital resources such as ancestry.com alongside digitized censuses, obituaries, birth records, and other available documents, the students in Dr. Hinson’s class become familiar with digital historical research that has a present-day impact. Their research then leads them into local communities to conduct interviews with the descendants of those who were victims of lynching, which are preserved in UNC’s Wilson Library as an oral history archive.Beyond the ultimate aim of this project to create public memorials for the victims of lynchings in their respective communities, this project also aims to develop curricula for schools to teach about their own local histories and create a website to make this project more publicly accessible."
